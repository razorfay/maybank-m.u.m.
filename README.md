# maybank-m.u.m.

There is an excessive number of youths going bankrupt every day and at the current rate, a large majority of youths are not going to be in a financially stable position and will continue to face problems until they learn some financial literacy. They have a habit of spending way over what they expected, sometimes without even knowing what they are spending it on. This needs to be dealt with and M.U.M. is the answer!

## The Solution
This app is intended to be integrated into the currently existing Maybank mobile app as an additional feature that users will be able to use, an additional tab will be included in the mobile app and from that tab it will lead them to this app that will be connected directly to the user's account details and will work in real time to update the user on their current status. This will allow the app to be added seamlessly into the existing app and once fully developed, to be shipped out immediately.
